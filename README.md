Antonio Augusto, Infrastructure analyst  - Student at Digital Innovation one

Much has been said about containers and consequently about Docker in the development environment. But what is the real role of a container in microservices scenarios? What is the real function and what practical examples can be applied in everyday life? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in a practical way by Expert Instructor Denilson Bonatti in this Live Coding. IMPORTANT: Now our Live Codings will take place on the official dio._ YouTube channel. So, run there and activate the reminder! Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Linux, Docker and AWS.
